# Google Cast App ID

AirPlayer cannot invent a Google Cast App ID locally. The ID is assigned by
Google after registering a receiver application in the Google Cast SDK Developer
Console.

## Get the ID

1. Open the Google Cast SDK Developer Console:
   `https://cast.google.com/publish`
2. Register or sign in with the account that should own the receiver.
3. Add a receiver application.
4. For development, register the Google TV / Android TV test device in the same
   console entry before publishing.
5. Copy the Application ID shown by the console.

Google's current registration docs:
`https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/registration`

For an Android TV native receiver, also associate the Android TV package name
with the Cast App ID in the console. AirPlayer's Google TV package is:

```text
com.airplayer.googletv
```

Google's Android TV receiver overview:
`https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/android_tv_receiver/`

## Build with the ID

Use either a Gradle property:

```bash
./gradlew assembleGoogletvDebug -Pairplayer.castAppId=<APP_ID>
```

or an environment variable:

```bash
AIRPLAYER_CAST_APP_ID=<APP_ID> ./gradlew assembleGoogletvDebug
```

If no ID is supplied, the Google TV build still succeeds, but AirPlayer marks
Cast as an error at runtime instead of pretending Cast is ready for testing.
With a valid ID, the Google TV flavor starts the official Cast Connect SDK.
Media load/playback handling still requires hardware validation with matching
Cast sender apps and DRM-free test media.

Fire TV builds do not use Google Cast because Fire TV does not include Google
Play Services.
