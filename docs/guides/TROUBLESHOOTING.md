# Troubleshooting

---

## Device not appearing in the AirPlay menu

**Cause 1: Not on the same network**
- Ensure your Mac/PC and the TV are connected to the **same Wi-Fi network** (same router, same subnet).
- Check: if your router has both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands with different SSIDs, make sure both devices use the same one.

**Cause 2: AP Isolation / Client Isolation**
- Some routers have "AP isolation" that prevents devices from seeing each other.
- Log into your router and disable "AP Isolation", "Client Isolation", or "Wireless Isolation".

**Cause 3: Multicast filtering**
- mDNS (used by AirPlay) requires multicast traffic. Some routers block this.
- Look for "Enable Multicast", "IGMP Snooping", or "mDNS" options in your router's advanced settings.

**Cause 4: AirPlayer service is stopped**
- Check the HomeScreen: the AirPlay status card should show "Running".
- If stopped, press the **Start** button or swipe to the control card.

## Connected but black screen

**Cause 1: FairPlay-protected content**
- Netflix, Disney+, Apple TV+, and other streaming services use FairPlay DRM.
- Apple blocks mirroring of protected content by design. This is not a AirPlayer limitation.
- Solution: use a different app/tab on your Mac.

**Cause 2: MediaCodec decoder unavailable**
- Rare: some cheap Android TV boxes lack H.264 hardware decode.
- Check logcat: `adb logcat -s AirPlayer` — look for "MediaCodec" errors.
- Solution: not fixable in software; the TV box needs hardware H.264 support.

## High latency (>200ms)

1. Switch from 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi to **5 GHz Wi-Fi** or **Ethernet**.
2. Move the TV closer to the router.
3. Check if other devices are using the same Wi-Fi band heavily.

## Audio out of sync

1. Try stopping and restarting the stream from your Mac.
2. Restart the AirPlayer service (HomeScreen → Restart button).
3. If persistent, check logcat for NTP timing errors.

## App crashes on startup

1. Try reinstalling: `adb uninstall com.airplayer` then install again.
2. Report the crash: attach `adb logcat -d` output to a GitHub Issue.
