**Optional (H.265 / HEVC):**
- [ ] Runtime HEVC capability check via `MediaCodecList.findDecoderForFormat("video/hevc")`
- [ ] SDP negotiation: detect `H265/90000` in `a=rtpmap`; fall back to H.264 if HEVC unavailable
- [ ] Advertise HEVC support in AirPlay `features` bitmask only if hardware supports it

**Definition of Done:** AC-4.x — ≥25fps, ≤100ms latency on Google TV for H.264 streams. HEVC streams play if hardware is capable.

- [x] `StreamStats.kt` — per-session RTP statistics
- [x] Audio-only mode: bypass VideoDecoder; stay on HomeScreen

**Optional surround audio:**
- [ ] Runtime surround capability check: `AudioManager.getDevices()` → check `AudioFormat.ENCODING_AC3` / `ENCODING_E_AC3_JOC` support
- [ ] AC-3 (Dolby Digital) output via AudioTrack with `ENCODING_AC3` if device supports it
- [ ] E-AC-3 / Dolby Atmos (JOC) output via AudioTrack with `ENCODING_E_AC3_JOC` if device supports it
- [ ] Advertise surround capability in AirPlay `features` bitmask only if hardware supports it

**Definition of Done:** AC-5.x — A/V sync ≤40ms. ALAC music streams play correctly. Surround audio passes through on capable hardware.

- [ ] `MiracastSession.kt` — WFD RTSP negotiation (capability exchange, `wfd-video-formats`, `wfd-audio-codecs`)
- [ ] WFD capability advertisement: report supported video/audio codecs in WFD capability exchange
- [ ] MPEG-TS demuxer: parse incoming MPEG Transport Stream; extract video/audio elementary streams

**Mandatory audio (LPCM):**
- [ ] `MiracastAudio.kt` — LPCM 16-bit / 48 kHz decode via AudioTrack direct pass-through

**Optional audio (AAC, AC-3):**
- [ ] AAC-LC / AAC-HE decode via MediaCodec; advertise in WFD `wfd-audio-codecs`
- [ ] AC-3 (Dolby Digital) pass-through via AudioTrack `ENCODING_AC3` (if device supports)
- [ ] Runtime audio capability check before advertising surround in WFD exchange

**DRM / copy protection:**
- [ ] Negotiate HDCP 2.x in WFD capability exchange (`wfd-content-protection`)
- [ ] Graceful fallback if HDCP negotiation fails: reject session with WFD RTSP 403

**UI:**
- [ ] Miracast status card updates in HomeScreen (connecting, streaming, codec info in debug overlay)

**Definition of Done:** AC-6.x — Windows 10 screen mirroring works end-to-end; LPCM and AAC audio work; H.265 works on capable hardware; HDCP negotiated.

## Risk Register

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| AirPlay undocumented behavior | High | High | Reference UxPlay/RPiPlay open-source implementations for protocol understanding; write code from scratch |
| Miracast requires hidden Android APIs on some devices | High | High | Use WifiP2pManager + custom WFD RTSP; test early on real hardware |
| Cast not available on Fire TV (no GMS) | Certain | Medium | Graceful fallback; disable Cast toggle on Fire TV flavor |
| Wi-Fi P2P conflicts with existing AP connection | Medium | High | Test multi-connected scenarios early |
| Google Cast SDK license terms | Low | High | Review carefully before distribution |
| Open-source AirPlay implementations: legal risk | Low | High | Reference only for protocol understanding; write code from scratch |
| H.265 / HEVC not available on all target devices | High | Low | Runtime capability check; feature advertised only when HW available; graceful fallback to H.264 |
| AV1 hardware decoder not available below API 31 | High | Low | Software AV1 decoder (API 29+) as fallback; advertise only if decoder found via MediaCodecList |
| HDCP negotiation fails on some Android TV hardware | Medium | Medium | Graceful WFD session rejection; log HDCP capability at startup; test on Fire TV (limited HDCP HW) |
| Dolby Atmos / AC-3 pass-through requires specific HDMI setup | Medium | Low | Runtime check via AudioManager; optional feature; disabled if not advertised by sink device |
| FairPlay DRM requested by users | Low | Low | Document clearly in FAQ: FairPlay not supported by design; AirPlay screen mirroring (non-DRM) works |
| Large JPEG/PNG images (e.g. 12MP from iPhone) cause OOM | Medium | Medium | Use BitmapFactory.Options.inSampleSize; downsample to display resolution before decoding |
| MPEG-TS demuxing complexity for WFD | Medium | High | Consider reusing ExoPlayer's TS extractor for WFD streams to avoid reimplementing demuxing |
